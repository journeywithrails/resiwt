== DESCRIPTION:

A Ruby API for bit.ly

http://code.google.com/p/bitly-api/wiki/ApiDocumentation

== INSTALLATION:

gem install bitly

== USAGE:

Create a Bitly client using your username and api key as follows:

bitly = Bitly.new(username, api_key)

You can then use that client to shorten or expand urls or return more information or statistics as so:

bitly.shorten('http://www.google.com')
bitly.shorten('http://www.google.com', :history => 1) # adds the url to the api user's history
bitly.expand('wQaT')
bitly.info('http://bit.ly/wQaT')
bitly.stats('http://bit.ly/wQaT')

Each can be used in all the methods described in the API docs, the shorten function, for example, takes a url or an array of urls.

All four functions return a Bitly::Url object (or an array of Bitly::Url objects if you supplied an array as the input). You can then get all the information required from that object.

u = bitly.shorten('http://www.google.com') #=> Bitly::Url

u.long_url #=> "http://www.google.com"
u.short_url #=> "http://bit.ly/Ywd1"
u.user_hash #=> "Ywd1"
u.hash #=> "2V6CFi"
u.info #=> a ruby hash of the JSON returned from the API
u.stats #=> a ruby hash of the JSON returned from the API

bitly.shorten('http://www.google.com', 'keyword')
