h1. Google::Geo

A simple, elegant library for getting geocoding information from Google Maps. Very much inspired by the google-geocode gem, but completely dependency free!

h2. Examples

  geo = Google::Geo.new API_KEY
  
  addresses = geo.locate '1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA'
  addresses.size # 1, :locate always returns an Array
  
  address = addresses.first
  address.country      # 'US'
  address.city         # 'Mountain View'
  address.full_address # '1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA'  
  address.query        # '1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA'
  address.accuracy     # 8
  address.coordinates  # [-122.084143, 37.421972, 0.0]

In the case of sufficiently vague queries, Google::Geo will return more than one:

  addresses = geo.locate 'hell'
  addresses.size                # 2
  addresses.map { |a| a.state } # ['PA', 'NC']

You can reverse geocode:

  address = geo.locate(33.998671, -118.075926).first
  address.city          # => Pico Rivera
  address.state         # => CA
  address.zip           # => 90660
  address.country       # => US
  address.full_address  # => 4952-4958 Tobias Ave, Pico Rivera, CA 90660, USA

You can optionally enable the ability to get street view embed HTML for an Address:

  require "google/geo/address/street_view"
  address.street_view_html :id => :street_view, :style => "width:640px; height:480px"

h2. Options

If you need to get the results in another language, you can set it like so:

  geo = Google::Geo.new API_KEY, "de"
  geo.language = "en"

The language code can be anything listed on "http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p9pdwsai2hDMsLkXsoM05KQ&gid=1":http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p9pdwsai2hDMsLkXsoM05KQ&gid=1.
