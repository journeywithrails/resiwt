About
=====================================
open flash chart 2 plugin for rails applications

This library was ported from the open flash chart project's php code to be used with Ruby on Rails.
Visit the open flash chart project here - http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart-2/

NOTE:
sample application is using haml
  gem install haml

If You use rails older that 2.3  probably  you have to uncomment method to_json (vendor/plugins/open_flash_chart/lib/open_flash_chart.rb line 14)
and add gem 'json' in enviroment.rb
otherwise plugin will not work propertly
